# Generalizing Verifiable Instruction Following

This repo contains IFBench, which is a new, challenging benchmark for precise instruction following.
Read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02833">IFBench paper</a>, accepted to NeurIPS 2025, D&B.

## IFBench
IFBench consists of two parts:

- OOD Constraints: 58 new and challenging constraints, with corresponding verification functions. The constraint templates are combined with prompts from a held-out set of WildChat (Zhao et al. 2024).

- (optionally) Multiturn Constraint Isolation in 2 turns: The prompt and the constraint are separated over two turns, i.e. the first turn is the user prompt and the model's response to the prompt, and the second turn is the constraint that modifies the initial prompt.

- New IF-RLVR training constraints: 29 new and challenging constraints, with corresponding verification functions. 

## Installation

IFBench is pip-installable. The package ships all OOD verifiers as well as the
classic Google IFEval verifiers, so it can serve as a single source of truth
for both registries.

```bash
pip install ifbench
# or
uv add ifbench
```

To work on IFBench itself, clone and sync with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allenai/IFBench.git
cd IFBench
uv sync
```

The package is namespaced under `ifbench` — submodules are `ifbench.instructions`,
`ifbench.classic_instructions`, `ifbench.instructions_registry`, and
`ifbench.instructions_util`. The test jsonl is bundled inside the wheel; access
it via `ifbench.data_path()`.

### Programmatic use

```python
from ifbench import instructions_registry

checker_cls = instructions_registry.INSTRUCTION_DICT["keywords:existence"]
checker = checker_cls("keywords:existence")
checker.build_description(keywords=["cat", "dog"])
checker.check_following("I saw a cat and a dog today.")  # True
```

`INSTRUCTION_DICT` contains 83 verifiers in total: 25 classic IFEval keys
(prefixed `keywords:`, `language:`, `length_constraints:`,
`detectable_content:`, `detectable_format:`, `combination:`, `startend:`,
`change_case:`, `punctuation:`) plus 58 IFBench OOD keys.

## How to run the evaluation
You need two jsonl files, one the IFBench_test.jsonl file (in the data folder) and one your file with eval prompts and completions (see sample_output.jsonl as an example). Then run:
```bash
uv run python -m run_eval --input_data=IFBench_test.jsonl --input_response_data=sample_output.jsonl --output_dir=eval
```

Note: In the paper we generally report the prompt-level loose accuracy of IFBench. When we generate for evaluation, we use a temperature of 0 and adjust the maximum generated tokens depending on the model type, i.e. for thinking models we allow to generate more tokens and we then process the output to extract the answer without the reasoning chains.

## Released Datasets
You can find our released datasets in this [collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/allenai/ifbench-683f590687f61b512558cdf1), which contains the [test data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/IFBench_test), the [multi-turn test data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/IFBench_multi-turn) and the [IF-RLVR training data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/IF_multi_constraints_upto5).

## RLVR for Precise Instruction Following
We also release our IF-RLVR code, as part of [open-instruct](https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct). You can run this [GRPO script](https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct/blob/main/open_instruct/grpo_fast.py), using our [training data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/IF_multi_constraints_upto5). This is an [example command](https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct/blob/main/scripts/train/rlvr/valpy_if_grpo_fast.sh).
